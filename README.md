# AADL support for Visual Studio Code

<table>
<tr>
<td>
    <p>
    Edit your AADL model with the Visual Studio Code AADL extension, and verify it with AADL Inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
    This extension adds full language support for AADL files into Visual Studio Code, including features such as syntax highlighting, outlines, error detection, reference navigation and renaming. It support the version 2.3 of AADL, i.e. complies with the <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5506c">SAE AS-5506C</a> standard.
    </p>
    <p>
    This extension is provided free of charge by <a href="https://www.ellidiss.com">Ellidiss Technologies</a> and implements a seamless connection to the <a href="#AADL-Inspector-Integration">AADL Inspector</a> commercial tool.

## Features

This extension contains a full AADL parser allowing error detection. It detects syntax errors and missing or duplicate references and presents them. It parses and checks errors in all openned files and files in the current workspaces. The reference resolution works accros files and uses all parsed files including from AIC project (see [AADL Inspector Integration](#AADL-Inspector-Integration)).

![Error](assets/errors.webp)

When hovering a reference, if the referenced element contains documentation (comments preceding the declaration). It will be presented as an hover popup.

![Documentation](assets/documentation.webp)

The resolved references by the parser are navigable in Visual Studio Code. Both by `Ctrl+Click` (or `Cmd+Click` on MacOS) to go to the definition or using *Go to References* or *Find all References*

![Navigation](assets/navigation.webp)

A full list of symbols is availaible using `Ctrl+P #` or `Cmd+P #`:

![Symbol](assets/symbols.webp)

This extension supports symbol renaming. By openning the contextual menu on a symbol and select `Rename Symbol` or by simply using `F2`, the extension will rename the symbol to the new name.

![Rename](assets/rename.webp)

### Commands

A command named `AADL: Create Prolog facts from source` will create a Prolog facts base for the selected AADL file. This facts base is compatible with the LMP model processing technology that is used by [AADL Inspector](#AADLInspector-Integration).

The command `AADL: Split file into one file for each package (OSATE compabitility)` split openned file into one file for each package.

## AADL Inspector Integration

[AADL Inspector](https://www.ellidiss.com/products/aadl-inspector/) ([detailed](https://www.ellidiss.fr/public/wiki/inspector)) is a model processing framework for Critical Software Architecture Models. It embeds or connects to a set of analysis tools applying on AADL projects in the areas of real-time performance, safety and cyber-security.

This extension provides a bridger to AADL Inspector. It is able to show .aic AADL project files in a dedicated explorer, launch AADL Inspector on a given file or project and run analysis tools. To benefit at best this functions, it needs AADL Inspector to be installed and the corresponding path to be set in the extension settings.

For further information about how to get AADL Inspector , please contact us at [support@ellidiss.com](mailto:support@ellidiss.com).

### Commands

The command `AADL: Launch AADL Inspector on current file and dependencies` will launch AADL Inspector on select AADL file or AIC project.

The command `AADL: Launch AADL Inspector plugin on current file and dependencies` will launch AADL Inspector and run a plugin on select AADL file or AIC project.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `aadl-ellidiss.maxDocumentSizeForParsing`: Maximum size for a document that can be parsed (in kilobytes). Default is 512 kilobytes.
* `aadl-ellidiss.AADL InspectorPath`: Path to AADL Inspector installation on your system.
