## Features

This extension contains a full AADL parser allowing error detection and reference resolution (go to definition or find references):

![Error](assets/errors.webp)

The reference resolution also allows for navigation between files:

![Navigation](assets/navigation.webp)

A full list of symbols is availaible using `Ctrl+P #` or `Cmd+P #`:

![Navigation](assets/symbols.webp)

A command named `AADL: Create Prolog statements from source` will create Prolog statements for the current AADL document. These statements are compatible with [AADLInspector](https://www.ellidiss.com/products/aadl-inspector/#1602496553568-50349c49-b4ce1b55-4004).

The command `AADL: Split file into one file for each package (OSATE compabitility)` split openned file into one file for each package.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `aadl-ellidiss.maxDocumentSizeForParsing`: Maximum size for a document that can be parsed (in kilobytes). Default is 1024 kilobytes.
