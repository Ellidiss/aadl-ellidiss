## Features

This extension contains a full AADL parser allowing error detection. It detects syntax errors and missing or duplicate references and presents them. It parses and checks errors in all openned files and files in the current workspaces. The reference resolution works accros files and uses all parsed files including from AIC project (see [AADLInspector Integration](#AADLInspectorIntegration)).

![Error](assets/errors.webp)

The resolved references by the parser are navigable in Visual Studio Code. Both by `Ctrl+Click` (or `Cmd+Click` on MacOS) to go to the definition or using *Go to References* or *Find all References*

![Navigation](assets/navigation.webp)

A full list of symbols is availaible using `Ctrl+P #` or `Cmd+P #`:

![Navigation](assets/symbols.webp)

This extension supports symbol renaming. By openning the contextual menu on a symbol and select `Rename Symbol` or by simply using `F2`, the extension will rename the symbol to the new name.

![Rename](assets/rename.webp)

### Commands

A command named `AADL: Create Prolog statements from source` will create Prolog statements for the current AADL document. These statements are compatible with [AADLInspector](https://www.ellidiss.com/products/aadl-inspector/#1602496553568-50349c49-b4ce1b55-4004).

The command `AADL: Split file into one file for each package (OSATE compabitility)` split openned file into one file for each package.

## AADLInspector Integration

[Ellidiss](https://www.ellidiss) provides [AADLInspector](https://www.ellidiss.com/products/aadl-inspector/) ([detailed](https://www.ellidiss.fr/public/wiki/inspector)). AADLInspector is a model processing framework for Critical Software Architecture Models. Based on the most recent version of the SAE-AS5506 (AADL) standard, it embeds a set of timing analysis, simulation and code generation tools. The tool also provides customizable input model converters for UML profiles or Domain Specific Modelling Languages.

This extension provides integration with AADLInspector. It's able to present AIC project files in a dedicated explorer, launch AADLInspector on a given file or project and run plugins. To benefit at best this functions, it needs an AADLInspector version installed and the path set in the extension (settings)(#Extension-Settings).

### Commands

The command `AADL: Launch AADLInspector on current file and dependencies` will launch AADLInspector on select AADL file or AIC project.

The command `AADL: Launch AADLInspector plugin on current file and dependencies` will launch AADLInspector and run a plugin on select AADL file or AIC project.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `aadl-ellidiss.maxDocumentSizeForParsing`: Maximum size for a document that can be parsed (in kilobytes). Default is 512 kilobytes.
* `aadl-ellidiss.AADLInspectorPath`: Path to AADLInspector installation on your system.
